### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself a multi-talented being. I spend most of my time building bespoke digital products.

I have been a product and interaction designer. I mainly specialise in front end tech stack using Javascript and Typescript as my language of choice paired with different frameworks such as Angular, VueJS and React.

Ofcourse, there is only so much that you can do with front end which is why my other hidden talent is Java with the Spring framework connecting to some NoSQL databases.

I like to dabble in the world of WordPress and Devops.

I have around 9 years experience in software development which includes software teams of different sizes as well.

The best way to define me is by the software projects that I want to pursue instead of looking only on the work I have done. Skills can be taught but personality is inherent. I have a passion to keep learning and challenging myself to do interesting things that matter.

Driven by making a difference in the world I am easily inspired. I always feel a need to act upon ideas instead of only talking about them. I am a people-person. I am been able to inspire others to achieve their goals. With software development the learning never stops.

I have been able to juggle multiple projects simultaneously while being able to quickly learn new technologies.

Contact me and lets talk about how we can solve problems.
