### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I spend most of my time building bespoke digital products. I am a firm believer in The Aggregation of Marginal Gains.

I have been a product and interaction designer. I mainly focus on Java and JavaScript as I believe that if you know the fundamentals of a programming language it will be easy to grasp the concepts of another.

Most of my coding experience comes from working in various startups.  I have also managed multi-disciplined software development teams ranging from 6 to 22 individuals.

The best way to define me is by the software projects that I want to pursue instead of looking only at the work I have done. 

Skills can be taught but personality is inherent. I have a passion to keep learning and challenging myself to do interesting things that matter.

Driven by making a difference in the world I am easily inspired. I always feel a need to act upon ideas instead of only talking about them. I am a people-person. I am been able to inspire others to achieve their goals. With software development the learning never stops.


I have been able to juggle multiple projects simultaneously while being able to quickly learn new technologies.
